Website structure:

{nav elem}
	0) Nav bar (almost done; I miss the mobile version - to be done later) 

{div id section1 > header elem}
	1) homepage /section 1 (same across all viewports): span entire screen (parallax) 

{div id section2 > header elem}
2) About section: 3 columns:
	- in row (large to medium screen)
	- in column (smaller devices)

	- in 2 rows of 2 (medium screen)
	- in column (smaller devices)

6) service section part 3: (same across all viewports): span entire screen

7) contact section: formspan entire screen (parallax):
	- one text div (always on one row)
	- one form with 4 inputs: Name, Email, Subject (first div) and Text with button (second div):
		- first three are in columns then Text in on same row ( ==> one block of 3 on left, text on right)
		- first three are in columns then Text in on same row (==> one block of 3 on top,text at bottom)

8) footer section: span entire screen (same across all viewports)

=====================

All 8 sections are in column and are independant.
