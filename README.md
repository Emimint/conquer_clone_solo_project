Title: 

Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - Website Template

This is a clone of the freely available CSS template website Conquer (https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer).


Overview:

The objectif was to implement a Bootstrap free of the original website as part of the Chingu voyage 42 requirement (https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-website-template). 

As such, the entire project is done using HTML, CSS and pure Javascript.

Additionally, one of the requirements of the project was to create a responsive website that would work on all devices.

Features:

    - Classical homepage 
        the website is made of four big sections including contact form. Each section is linked to a navbar menu. 
    - Dynamic navbar
        At a certain minimal width, the navbar is switched to a mobile format responding just the same. 
    - "scrolling back up" button
        At a certain height within the page, a "scrolling back up" button appears and can be used to reach the top of the page.
    -Parallax effect:
        A special visual effect is used to enhance the aspect of the page (more info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling).

Running The Project:

The resulting website is deployed here: https://emimint.github.io/conquer_clone_solo_project/.

All files are hosted at https://github.com/Emimint/conquer_clone_solo_project.

No specific library or framework are required to run this project: it is possible to either clone the entire gitHub repository, or download all files to your computer. Then, open the "index.html" page from any browser for it to be locally displayed.

Contributions:

Here are some functions missing or incomplete that will/should be fixed in the future:

- the Parallax effet not working on iOS devices (when tested on iPad 9th generation iOS 15.7.1)
- the "click on page to live the mobile navbar menu" function is missing
